# OCR Detection Model

This project involves building an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model to detect and extract text from images. The model is designed to accurately identify and convert text present in images into a machine-readable format.

## Features

- **Text Detection**: Accurately detects text in images, including handwritten or printed text.
- **Text Extraction**: Converts detected text into editable and searchable machine-readable text.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: The model is capable of detecting text in multiple languages.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of images efficiently.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different use cases and types of text.
